## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
**OpenAPI Generator Cucumber Templates** is a collection of templates for [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) which run automated tests from Cucumber feature documents written in [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/). Because they're written in Gherkin, they can be run against all of your generated clients.

## ðŸŽ¯ Requirements
The templates must be used with [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation). Version **7.11.0** is currently recommended for use with these templates.

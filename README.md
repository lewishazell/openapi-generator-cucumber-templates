## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
**OpenAPI Generator Cucumber Templates** is a collection of templates for [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) which implement Cucumber tests for generated clients and allow writing automated tests in Ghehrkin syntax. Because they're written in Gherkin syntax, they only need to be written once to test all generated clients.

## ðŸŽ¯ Requirements
The templates must be used with [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation). Version **7.11.0** is currently recommended for use with these templates.
